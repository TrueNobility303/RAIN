# RAIN (Recursive Anchoing IterRation)

Offical codes for "Near-optimal algorithms for making the gradient small in stochastic minimax optimization."

We conduct numerical experiments on the following three hard instances:
*  a convex-concave bilinear function 
*  a convex-concave $(\delta,\nu)$ function with additive Guassian noise. 
*  a nonconvex-nonconcave function under the comonotonicity condition.
